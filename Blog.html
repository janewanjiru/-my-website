         How women were potrayed in the society</h2>
            <p>The Author explains why Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a <br>
           traditional wife where it was even believed that women in the traditional society <br>
           were to be  subservient to their husbands.Abel wanted a woman to bow to him <br>
           that's why he married Noah's mother Patricia as she was the opposite of that in every way<br>
           she was also expected to play her traditional role too but she refused <br>
           like the whole tradition of women in Tzaneen bowing to the men but to Patricia<br>
           it was absurd but she did not refuse to do it instead she made a mockery of it <br>

           <h2>How Humor is used in Born a Crime Book</h2>
           <p>Humor portrays itself in chapter 6 when Trevor was in Maryvale school where other kids  <br>
            could eat jesus's body and drink jesus's blood which was grape juice of which he loved it<br>
            but they would not let Trevor have any because he was not a Catholic and he would argue <br>
            with the nuns and the priest all the time."One morning before mass I decided I am going <br>
            get some jesus blood and body.I snuck behind the altar and I drank the entire bootle of<br>
            grape juice and I ate the entire bag of Eucharist to make up for all the other times that<br>
            I could not".later principal was giving Trevor an ultimatum that would get him to shape up <br>
            but he did not want to be in there anymore and he dropout out from Catholic School.Funnily<br>
            enough he did not get into trouble with her mom ,but she sided with him against Maryvale<br>
            more often than not and also Trevor's mother had lost the bursary when she left her job<br>
            at ICI and paying for private school was becoming a burden.but more than that she thought <br>
             the school was overreacting<br>

           <p>Chapter 17 Humor is showed when Trevor was arrested by the cops on the suspicion of driving <br>
            a stolen vehicle where he was going for a shop which was out of suburbs,and it was too far to<br>
            walk.The mazda being one of Abel's junkers Trevor used to steal and he would say he was test<br>
            driving them to make sure they had been repaired correctly.The cop called in the number-plate<br>
            registration and discovered that it did not much with the car.In south Africa,everyone knows <br>
            that colored gangsters are the most ruthless, and the most savage for instance when he went <br>
            to a club the bouncer searched his cousin Mlungisi,waved him but he searched Trevor and got<br>
            up in his face being in suspence with him.when he was in jail he figured that people had the<br>
            mentority that he was kind of a colored person who ends up in jail,being a violent and <br>
            criminal person Trevor played it up and anytime the cops asked him questions he started <br>
            speaking in broken Afrikaanswith a thick colored accent.He used that idea to survive in jail.<br>

           </p>
            <p>Trevor's friend who is called Tom told him that they were going to see a talent show not<br>
            knowing he was the one being referred to as the one who is going to entertain people.<br>
            Trevor had a pair of Timbeland boots which was the only decent piece of clothing he owned.<br>
            Back then,almost no one in south Africa had Timberlands but everyone wanted them because <br>
            American rappers wore them.Tom told Trevor to wear his Timberland. When they got there <br>
            Tom was going around,shaking hands,chatting with everybody.There was singing,dancing,some<br>
            poetry The host got up onstage welcoming a special performer,a rapper from America called <br>
            Spliff Star then everybody looked at Trevor.Tom walked over and whispered in Trevor's ear<br>
            "Dude,come up onstage." "what?" "Dude, what are you thinking about?".Tom was pleading Trevor<br>
            to come on stage because he will cause him to be in so much trouble since he was already being<br>
            paid.Trevor got up onstage and Tom did some terrible beat-boxing while he stumbled through some <br>
            Busta Rhymes lyrics that made the audience erupted with cheers and applause which made him being famous.<br>

               </p>
           <p>Humor portrays where Trevor explains that the only time he could be with his father was when they<br>
            are only indoors when they are out of the house,his dad would walk across the street from them.Trevor<br>
            and his mum used to go to joubert park all the time which was the central park of Johannesburg beautiful<br>
            garden that people would play.Trevor's mother told him that once when he was a toddler,his dad tried to <br>
            walk with them but a good bit away from them,therefore he was running after him ,screaming."Daddy!Daddy!Daddy!"<br>
            then people started looking at them then his dad panic and start running away and Trevor thought it was a game<br>
            and kept chasing him.<br>
                 </p>
           <p>It was when Trevor and his mother made a circuit of churches ending up as usual,at white church.When they walked <br>
            out of Rosebank Union it was dark they were alone they waited for minibus since under apartheid the government <br>
            provided no public transport for blacks eventually they were offered a ride by one of the car that drove up and stopped<br>
            next to them.After they had gone for a while a minibus swerved right in front of the car and cuts them off.A zullu driver<br>
            got out of the car grabbed the man who would offered them a ride they got out of the first car and climbed into the minibus<br>
            as they rode along the man started lecturing Trevor's mother about being in a car with a man who was not her husband.later <br>
            when he heard she speaks in Xhosa that really set him off since they believed Zullu women were well behaved and dutiful unlike<br>
            Xhosa who were promiscuous and unfaithful.The driver was driving fast and he was not stopping,only slowing down to check for <br>
            traffic at the intersections before speeding through they decided to jump out of the car where humaor displays itself as she <br>
            was telling Trevor to run and he run like the gazelle runs from the lion .<br>
